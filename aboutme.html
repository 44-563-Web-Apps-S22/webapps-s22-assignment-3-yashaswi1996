<h3> THOR</h3>
<p>
    Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, 
    from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania, to the Germanic expansions of the Migration 
    Period, to his high popularity during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of 
    the Christianization of Scandinavia, emblems of his hammer, Mj√∂lnir, were worn and Norse 
    pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.
