        <h3>Norway Neptune</h3>
        <p>
            Mascot is something, especially a person or animal, used to symbolize a sports team,
             company, organization or other group. Team mascots are often confused with team 
             nicknames. While two can be interchangeable, they are nuot always the same. In this project,
             mascot is referred for a polo sports team and the mascot is yak which is black in color.
